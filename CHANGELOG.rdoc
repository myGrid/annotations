== 0.3.0
* +acts_as_annotatable+ now requires you to specify an option - +:name_field+ - on the model that is becoming an annotatable.
* +acts_as_annotatable+ now exposes an +is_annotatable+ attribute to allow you to check if a model can act as an annotatable. 

== 0.2.1
* Updated the routes to allow +requirements+ to be passed in.

== 0.2.0
*Main change*: 
Annotation values are now polymorphic rather than just plain strings. 
Some basic +act_as_annotation_value+ models have been introduced for this. 
Note: this has affected all methods that take in or work with annotation values. 
See below for further details.

* New mixin module: +acts_as_annotation_value+.
* New basic annotation value models: +TextValue+ and +NumberValue+ (but note that you can use any model as a value by specifying +acts_as_annotation_value+ on it).
* Removed +Annotation::find_annotatables_with_attribute_name_and_value+.
* Removed +Annotation::find_annotatables_with_attribute_names_and_values+.
* Removed +with_annotations_with_attribute_name_and_value+ in the +acts_as_annotatable+ module.
* +Annotations::Config::value_restrictions+ has been renamed to +Annotations::Config::content_restrictions+
* Latest migration version = v3
* NOTE: the new migration script will keep the old +value+ column data in a new +old_value+ column for EXISTING annotations only. This can be used for verification/text purposes.

== 0.1.1
* Added +identifier+ to +AnnotationAttribute+. This can be used to specify what ontology term / URI the attribute can be
  uniquely identified using. See +AnnotationAttribute#before_validation+ for more information on how this identifier
  will be generated if not specified manually.
* Changed the +annotations+ association in +act_as_annotation_source+ to +annotations_by+, to fix cases when a model has both
  +acts_as_annotatable+ AND +acts_as_annotation_source+.
* Latest migration version = v2

== 0.1.0 (July 23rd 2009)
* Initial import from the BioCatalogue codebase.
* Improved documentation. See README.rdoc for more info on features and usage.
* Latest migration version = v1
