= Running Tests

To run the tests for this plugin:

* you have to install this into a dummy Rails v2.3.x app and meet the requirements (see the README file).

* ensure the gem 'plugin_test_helper' is installed (only tested with v0.3.0).

* ensure database 'annotations_plugin_test' exists on a local MySQL server installation (with default ports) and username 'annotations' with password 'annotations_plugin'. Commands for MySQL:

  create database annotations_plugin_test character set utf8;
  create user 'annotations'@'localhost' identified  by 'annotations_plugin';
  grant all privileges on annotations_plugin_test.* to 'annotations'@'localhost';  

* In the root of the dummy Rails app, run:

  rake test:plugins PLUGIN=annotations
